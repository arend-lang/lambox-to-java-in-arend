# The producer of the `lean-benchmarks` corpus' programs: closes every benchmark
# of upstream's `benchmarks/TESTS` over one small input and erases it to a λ□
# `.ast` file in $WORK_DIR/lean-benchmarks/.
#
# Upstream has no `.ast` files to point a corpus row at: a benchmark is a Lean
# FUNCTION (`Nat -> Nat` or `Unit -> Unit`), and its Makefile erases a closed
# wrapper into a build directory named after the malfunction configuration. So
# the corpus needs the same wrapper, which is what this script writes -- one
# `#erase` per benchmark, all in a single Lean file, i.e. one elaboration for the
# whole suite. The result is a CACHE, not checked in: the corpus stays "no
# per-program files in the repository", and `corpora/lean-benchmarks.sh` simply
# prints no row for a benchmark whose `.ast` is not there.
#
# Input value: fixed at 10 below -- a coverage suite, not a performance run
# (upstream's own counts, up to 10^8, would run for minutes each).
# corpora/lean-benchmarks.expected holds the Lean `#eval` value at THAT input, so
# the two must be regenerated together (changing `input` here included); the
# header of that file says how.
#
# Read-only towards upstream: nothing is written below the lean-to-lambdabox
# directory, and `lake build` is deliberately NOT run -- the benchmark library
# must already be built there (it is what LEAN_PATH points at).
