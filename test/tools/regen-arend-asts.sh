#
# Refreshes the checked-in `prog.ast` of the three AREND-AUTHORED programs.
#
# Every program in the corpus is a λ□ s-expression file -- that is the single
# program input shape of the harness, so `example`, `peano` and `matmul`, whose
# source is a hand-written `LBTerm` in the Arend project rather than a file from
# Lean or Rocq, need their term serialized once and committed. This script is the
# only producer of those files; the harness itself never runs Arend to obtain a
# program, only to compile one.
#
# The round trip that makes this legitimate -- serialize with `Serialize.ard`,
# read back with `tools/ast-to-arend`, compile, and get the same output as
# compiling the original term -- is what the retired `peano-ast` and `matmul-ast`
# cases used to check by hand. Running it on every program instead of on two is
# an improvement, not a loss: `Serialize` and the importer are now on the path of
# all three.
#
# Cost: one Arend CLI run per program, ~40 s each (library loading dominates), so
# this is a rare, manual step -- never part of a `run.py` run.
#
# `letchain` is the fourth such program (test/benchmarks.md: the `letIn` worst
# case); it declares only the java backend, so it needs no attribute files.
#
# `matmul` additionally needs its two attribute files, which are extracted from
# the same Arend module and are refreshed here as well. They are four fixed
# declarations independent of the matrix size, which is why they are checked in
# rather than re-extracted per run.
