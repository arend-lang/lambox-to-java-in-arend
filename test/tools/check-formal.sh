#
# Typechecks the formalization. NOTHING ELSE DOES, on purpose: no module of the
# translation imports `Formal.*`, so `golden.py` and `run.py` never look at it
# and a normal compile stays as cheap as it was. The cost of that is this
# script's reason to exist -- without it, the semantics rots silently the first
# time `compileClass`, `runClass` or `evalT` changes shape, and nobody finds out
# until they next remember to name a module by hand.
#
# TYPECHECKING IS THE CHECKING. Everything in there is either a proof
# (`renderName` injective) or a run whose expected value is asserted by `idp`
# (the fragment's semantics on compiled programs; λ□'s semantics and the
# fragment's agreeing on the same program). So a disagreement is a type error,
# and this script needs no output of its own beyond Arend's.
#
# Two projects, because the checks that need λ□ PROGRAMS live where the programs
# are (the examples project, which depends on the compiler one). Each project
# takes one invocation with all its modules, since the ~18 s of parsing arend-lib
# is per invocation, not per module (see extract-arend.sh).
