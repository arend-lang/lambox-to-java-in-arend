# The `lean-benchmarks` corpus: lean-to-lambdabox's own benchmark suite, one row
# per line of its `benchmarks/TESTS` manifest.
#
# Upstream ships Lean sources, not λ□ programs, so the `.ast` files are a CACHE
# produced by tools/extract-lean-benchmarks.sh (each benchmark closed over input
# 10) under work/lean-benchmarks/ -- nothing per-program is checked in here. A
# benchmark whose `.ast` is not in the cache simply gets no row, and with the
# upstream directory absent the manifest is missing and the corpus prints
# nothing at all, which run.py reports as unavailable.
#
# Six of these benchmarks also exist in the handwritten corpus (`lean-qsort`,
# `lean-deriv`, ...). They stay separate programs on purpose: those are pinned,
# checked-in `.ast` files closed over their own inputs, these follow upstream's
# manifest at whatever revision is installed. The `leanbench-` prefix keeps the
# two sets of program IDs apart -- an ID is what names a work directory and a
# generated Arend module, so it has to be unique across corpora.
#
# `expected` comes from Lean's own `#eval` at the same input; see
# lean-benchmarks.expected, which has no row for the five benchmarks returning
# `Unit` or a list.
